# NFLQBs

This whole proyect consists on analyzing the TD's and other stats of each NFL quarterback that has played at least once in the last 10 years.

I had to join all of the tables with a full inner join, to do this I first joined the tables from the 2011 to the 2014 seasons. (Mainly cause I wasn't being able to join 10 tables at the same time). After that I ended up with the combined touchdowns of every single QB (or whoever threw a single pass during the past decade)

With the tables joined already, I could quickly do the same with another stat (either games started, completions, interceptions, etc)
I'll try to update this to reveal more data and might to it with another position

I downloaded the databases from: https://www.pro-football-reference.com
